Certainly! Here are some TypeScript interview questions along with brief answers:

1. **What is TypeScript?**
   - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features for better tooling, maintainability, and scalability.

2. **What are the benefits of using TypeScript?**
   - Benefits include static typing, early error detection, improved code maintainability, enhanced IDE support, better refactoring capabilities, and access to modern JavaScript features.

3. **How do you declare a variable with a specific type in TypeScript?**
   - Use type annotations: `let age: number = 25;`

4. **Explain the difference between `null` and `undefined` in TypeScript.**
   - `null` represents the intentional absence of any object value, while `undefined` signifies the absence of a value (often unintentional).

5. **What are interfaces in TypeScript?**
   - Interfaces define a contract for objects, specifying required properties, methods, and their types.

6. **How can you achieve type checking on function arguments and return values?**
   - By using function type annotations: `function add(a: number, b: number): number { return a + b; }`

7. **What are union types in TypeScript?**
   - Union types allow a value to be of multiple types: `let value: string | number;`

8. **Explain the concept of type inference in TypeScript.**
   - TypeScript can automatically deduce the type of a variable based on its initialization or usage, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.

9. **How do you define and use enums in TypeScript?**
   - Enums provide a set of named constants: `enum Color { Red, Green, Blue } let selectedColor: Color = Color.Green;`

10. **What are generics in TypeScript and why are they useful?**
    - Generics allow you to create functions and classes that work with different data types while maintaining type safety and code reusability.

11. **What is a type assertion (type cast) in TypeScript?**
    - A type assertion tells the compiler to treat a value as a specific type: `let length: number = (userInput as string).length;`

12. **Explain the concept of type guards.**
    - Type guards are runtime checks that narrow down the type of a value within a conditional block, enhancing type safety.

13. **How can you use decorators in TypeScript?**
    - Decorators are used to add metadata or behavior to classes, methods, properties, or parameters. They're commonly used in frameworks like Angular.

14. **What is module resolution in TypeScript?**
    - Module resolution refers to how TypeScript finds and loads external modules. It can be based on module paths or Node.js-style resolution.

15. **What are mapped types in TypeScript?**
    - Mapped types allow you to transform properties of an existing type into a new type using mapped property keys.

16. **Explain the difference between interfaces and classes in TypeScript.**
    - Interfaces define the structure and shape of objects, while classes define both structure and behavior.

17. **How can you declare optional properties in an interface?**
    - Use the `?` symbol: `interface Person { name: string; age?: number; }`

18. **What is the `readonly` modifier in TypeScript?**
    - The `readonly` modifier indicates that a property can only be assigned a value once, typically during initialization.

19. **How can you use the `namespace` keyword in TypeScript?**
    - Namespaces provide a way to organize code by grouping related declarations under a common name.

20. **What is the difference between `require()` and `import` in TypeScript?**
    - `require()` is the CommonJS module system used in Node.js, while `import` is the ES6 module syntax supported by TypeScript for browser and modern environments.

Remember that these are brief answers. In an interview, you might be asked to provide more detailed explanations or demonstrate your knowledge through coding examples.
