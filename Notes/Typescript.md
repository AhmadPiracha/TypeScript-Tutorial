TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, which means that TypeScript extends and adds features to JavaScript while maintaining compatibility with existing JavaScript code. TypeScript's primary goal is to make JavaScript development more manageable, maintainable, and scalable by adding static typing and other features not present in standard JavaScript.

Key features of TypeScript include:

1. **Static Typing:** TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to explicitly declare the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch type-related errors at compile-time, making code more robust and easier to debug.

2. **Interfaces and Type Annotations:** TypeScript allows you to define interfaces and create type annotations to describe the shape and structure of objects, functions, and other data.

3. **Type Inference:** TypeScript's compiler can often infer types based on context, reducing the need for explicit type annotations in every part of the code.

4. **Classes and Modules:** TypeScript supports object-oriented programming concepts like classes, interfaces, and modules, making it easier to organize and structure larger projects.

5. **Compile-Time Checks:** The TypeScript compiler performs type checks and other validations at compile-time, catching potential issues before the code is executed, leading to more reliable software.

6. **ES6 and Beyond:** TypeScript supports the latest ECMAScript features, providing access to modern JavaScript language features even before they are fully supported in all browsers.

7. **Code Refactoring:** TypeScript tools provide intelligent code completion, navigation, and refactoring capabilities in modern integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code.

8. **Compatibility:** TypeScript code can be transpiled (converted) into regular JavaScript, which means that TypeScript projects can run in any browser or Node.js environment.

Developers often use TypeScript for building large-scale web applications, libraries, and projects where maintaining code quality, preventing bugs, and improving developer productivity are essential. TypeScript is especially popular within the Angular framework ecosystem, although it can be used in a wide range of other web development scenarios as well.
